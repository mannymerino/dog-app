## Overview
There’s a bourgeoning market for dog pictures! This React app helps us visualize the world’s canines by providing the following features.
## Features
* Uses the free and open [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)
* The landing page has a list of dog breeds displayed
* Clicking on a dog breed displays a single picture of that breed
* While viewing a breed the user is able to
  * Refresh the image with another image of that breed
  * Navigate back to the list of breeds
## Usage
*(This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app))*

Clone this repository locally, then run the following commands within the application folder:
```npm
npm install
npm start
```
## Future Improvements / Features
- [ ] Sorting of breeds list
